# Landfill of Broken Code and Stolen Assets(TM)
Not finished (duh!)

## Stuff which is finished, in development or broken
If something is not on this list, that means its either extremely broken or not being developed yet

| Status | Feature | Notes |
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| ✅ | Player movement | Should work and feel (mostly) like in Deltarune |
| ⚠️ | Touch support   | Very basic, needs more refining(like, come on, i can do better than these pesky PS4 buttons and a D-Pad!) |
| ⚠️ | Dialog system   | Mostly done, but currently its a bit broken(skip doesnt work for example) |
| ⚠️ | Level change    | Only works when used linearly, if a level has several level changes(`ch1/level/living_room.tscn`), the player will spawn at the default location |
| ❌ | Battles         | `base/object/battle.tscn`(i wanna die) |
| ❌ | Chapter 1       | No |
